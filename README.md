# Random-number-generator-
My first PHP project 

# Project Requirements 

An input box to assign how many dice to roll

A drop down box to select the sides of the dice (for example d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20)

A PHP rand(); function taking the inputs from the form

An output to show # of dice rolled, the type of dice (d4, d6 ..), the total count of the dices rolled

Output the details (number) of the individual dice rolls (Possibly using a foreach loop)

# Implementation 

PHP will create the functionality - the generation of random numbers based on dice rolls.

HTML - this will be used to create forms/input boxes 

CSS - this will allow the page to be styled 

Server: Local web server with XAMPP
